The easiest way to link the library is using the CLI tool by running this command from the root of your project:\n\n```\n$ react-native link @react-native-community/masked-view\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nImport the `MaskedView` component from `@react-native-community/masked-view` and use it like so:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport MaskedView from '@react-native-community/masked-view';\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <MaskedView\n        style={{ flex: 1, flexDirection: 'row', height: '100%' }}\n        maskElement={\n          <View\n            style={{\n              // Transparent background because mask is based off alpha channel.\n              backgroundColor: 'transparent',\n              flex: 1,\n              justifyContent: 'center',\n              alignItems: 'center'\n            }}\n          >\n            <Text\n              style={{\n                fontSize: 60,\n                color: 'black',\n                fontWeight: 'bold'\n              }}\n            >\n              Basic Mask\n            </Text>\n          </View>\n        }\n      >\n        {/* Shows behind the mask, you can put anything here, such as an image */}\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#324376' }} />\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#F5DD90' }} />\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#F76C5E' }} />\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#e1e1e1' }} />\n      </MaskedView>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following image demonstrates that you can put almost anything behind the mask. The three examples shown are masked `<View>`, `<Text>`, and `<Image>`.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/example.png\" width=\"200\"></img></p>\n\n### Props\n\n- [View props...](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/blob/master/docs/view.md#props)\n\n* [`maskElement`](#maskelement)\n\n# Reference\n\n## Props\n\n### `maskElement`\n\n| Type    | Required |\n| ------- | -------- |\n| element | Yes      |\n\n<!-- badges -->\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/react-native-community/react-native-masked-view/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[build]: https://circleci.com/gh/react-native-community/react-native-masked-view\n[version-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@react-native-community/masked-view.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/masked-view\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@react-native-community/masked-view.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[lean-core-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Lean%20Core-Extracted-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[lean-core-issue]: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313",

Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:\n    ```gradle\n    include ':unimodules-core'\n    project(':unimodules-core').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@unimodules/core/android')\n    ```\n2.  Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:\n    ```gradle\n    compile project(':unimodules-core')\n    ```\n3.  If you're using ProGuard, you'll need to append these lines to your ProGuard rules file for it not to strip out methods required for Expo modules to work.\n    ```pro\n    -keepclassmembers class * {\n      @org.unimodules.interfaces.ExpoProp *;\n    }\n    -keepclassmembers class * {\n      @org.unimodules.interfaces.ExpoMethod *;\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Glossary\n\n- **Native code** — iOS/Android native code.\n- **Client code** — code _over the bridge_, for React Native it's the JavaScript app.\n- **Internal module** — a class implementing `UMInternalModule`/`org.unimodules.interfaces.InternalModule` interface. Its instance can be exposed internally to other modules via *Module Registry* (how dependants reference modules differs between platforms).\n- **Module interface** — an interface that should be implemented by the dependency so it can act as an implementation of it.\n\n    On Android modules implement an external interface (`expo-file-system` package implements interface provided by `expo-file-system-interface`). Dependants may access the implementations by calling\n    ```java\n    public <T> T getModule(Class<T> interfaceClass);\n    ```\n    method on the module registry.\n\n    On iOS its the consumer who defines required protocol. Implementations are identified by a protocol. Dependants access the implementation by calling\n    ```objc\n    - (id)getModuleImplementingProtocol:(Protocol *)protocol;\n    ```\n    method on the module registry.\n- **Module Registry** — well, a registry of modules. Instance of this class is used to fetch another internal or exported module.\n- **Exported methods** — a subset of instance methods of a given module that should get exposed to client code by specific platform adapter.\n- **Exported module** — a subclass of `{UM,org.unimodules.}ExportedModule`. Its methods annotated with `org.unimodules.ExpoMethod`/`UM_EXPORT_METHOD_AS` are exported to client code.\n- **View manager** — a class capable of providing platform adapter with custom views.\n\n### Registering modules in the registry\n\n#### iOS\n\n1. Open the header file for your module.\n2. Import `<UMCore/UMInternalModule.h>`.\n3. Add `UMModule` to a list of implemented interfaces by the module instances (eg. `NSObject <UMInternalModule>`). \n4. Open the implementation file for your module and implement methods required by the protocol.\n5. Use `UM_REGISTER_MODULE();` macro to register the module.\n6. That's it!\n\n#### Android\n\n1. Add `org.unimodules.interfaces.InternalModule` to your class's imports.\n2. Make your module class implement `InternalModule` interface.\n    1. Implement `public List<Class> getExportedInterfaces();`. Return a list of module interfaces implemented by the class, for example:\n        ```java\n        return Collections.singletonList((Class) org.unimodules.interfaces.filesystem.FileSystem.class);\n        ```\n3. Create a `Package` class for your module, unless you already have one.\n    1. A `Package` class should implement `org.unimodules.Package` interface (a `BasePackage` class is provided for you not to have to implement all the initialization flavors at once).\n    2. Add the `Package` to a `List` provided to `ModuleRegistryBuilder`.\n        ```java\n        new ModuleRegistryBuilder(\n          Arrays.<Package>asList(\n            new FileSystemPackage()\n          )\n        )\n        ```\n4. Add your module to be returned by `List<InternalModule> createInternalModules(Context context);`.\n5. You're good to go!\n\n### Exporting module to client code\n\n#### iOS\n\nWhen registering your module for export to client code, you must first decide whether the class will only be exported to client code or will it be both internal and exported module. If the former is applicable, you easily just subclass `UMExportedModule` and use macro `UM_EXPORT_MODULE(clientCodeName)` to provide a name under which it should be exported. If your module should be both internal and exported module, you also have to subclass `UMExportedModule`, but this time use `UM_REGISTER_MODULE()` in the implementation and then manually override methods `exportedInterfaces` and `exportedModuleName`.\n\n#### Android\n\nSubclass `org.unimodules.ExportedModule` and add your module to a list returned by `Package` in `createExportedModules()`.\n\n### Exporting methods and calling exported methods\n\n#### iOS\n\nUse `UM_EXPORT_METHOD_AS(exportedName, definition)` macro to export given method to client code. Note that for the module to be available in the client code you have to provide a non-empty client code name in `UM_EXPORT_MODULE(clientCodeName)` or `- (const NSString *)exportedModuleName`. For now, arguments have to use basic, object types, like `NSString *`, `NSDictionary *`, `NSNumber *`. Methods are required to receive `UMPromiseResolveBlock` and `UMPromiseRejectBlock` as two last arguments.\n\n#### Android\n\nGiven that your module subclasses `org.unimodules.ExportedModule` and it is returned by the respective `Package`, you just have to annotate the given method with `@ExpoMethod` annotation. Methods are required to receive `org.unimodules.Promise` as the last argument.\n\n### Exporting constants to client code\n\n#### iOS\n\nImplement `- (NSDictionary *)constantsToExport` method to export constants to client code.\n\n#### Android\n\nOverride `public Map<String, Object> getConstants();` method to export constants to client code.\n\n### Creating a custom view manager\n\n#### iOS\n\nSubclass `UMViewManager` and override at least `- (UIView *)view` and `- (NSString *)viewName`. Register it with `UM_REGISTER_MODULE()`.\n\nUse `UM_VIEW_PROPERTY(propName, propClass, viewClass)` to define custom view properties.\n\n#### Android\n\nTODO: ViewManager from interface to a class\n\nImplement `org.unimodules.interfaces.ViewManager` in your class and respond with its instance in `List<ViewManager> createViewManagers(Context context);` in corresponding `Package`.\n\nAnnotate prop setter methods with `@ExpoProp(name = <name>)` to define custom view properties.",

It requires [`@unimodules/core`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/@unimodules/core) to be installed and linked.\n\n## JavaScript installation\n\n```sh\n$ yarn add @unimodules/react-native-adapter\n\n# or\n\n$ npm install @unimodules/react-native-adapter --save\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you are using `react-native-unimodules`, this package will already be installed and configured!\n\n### iOS (Cocoapods)\n\nIf you're using Cocoapods, add the dependency to your `Podfile`:\n\n`pod 'UMReactNativeAdapter', path: '../node_modules/@unimodules/react-native-adapter/ios', inhibit_warnings: true`\n\nand run `npx pod-install`.\n\n### Android\n\n1.  Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:\n    ```gradle\n    include ':unimodules-react-native-adapter'\n    project(':unimodules-react-native-adapter').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@unimodules/react-native-adapter/android')\n    ```\n2.  Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:\n    ```gradle\n    compile project(':unimodules-react-native-adapter')\n    ```\n\n## Additional required setup\n\n#### iOS\n\n1. Open the `AppDelegate.m` of your application.\n2. Import `<UMCore/UMModuleRegistry.h>`, `<UMReactNativeAdapter/UMNativeModulesProxy.h>` and `<UMReactNativeAdapter/UMModuleRegistryAdapter.h>`.\n3. Make `AppDelegate` implement `RCTBridgeDelegate` protocol (`@interface AppDelegate () <RCTBridgeDelegate>`).\n4. Add a new instance variable to your `AppDelegate`:\n\n   ```objc\n   @interface AppDelegate () <RCTBridgeDelegate>\n\n   // add this line\n   @property (nonatomic, strong) UMModuleRegistryAdapter *moduleRegistryAdapter;\n\n   @end\n   ```\n\n5. In `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` add the following at the top of the implementation:\n   ```objc\n   self.moduleRegistryAdapter = [[UMModuleRegistryAdapter alloc] initWithModuleRegistryProvider:[[UMModuleRegistryProvider alloc] init]];\n   ```\n6. Add two methods to the `AppDelegate`'s implementation:\n\n   ```objc\n   - (NSArray<id<RCTBridgeModule>> *)extraModulesForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge\n   {\n       NSArray<id<RCTBridgeModule>> *extraModules = [_moduleRegistryAdapter extraModulesForBridge:bridge];\n       // If you'd like to export some custom RCTBridgeModules that are not Expo modules, add them here!\n       return extraModules;\n   }\n\n   - (NSURL *)sourceURLForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge {\n       return [[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@\"index\" fallbackResource:nil];\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. When initializing `RCTBridge`, make the `AppDelegate` a delegate of the bridge:\n   ```objc\n   RCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:self launchOptions:launchOptions];\n   ```\n\n   or, if you use `react-native-navigation`, add the `bridgeManagerDelegate` parameter of `self`, like:\n   ```diff\n   -[ReactNativeNavigation bootstrap:jsCodeLocation launchOptions:launchOptions];\n   +[ReactNativeNavigation bootstrap:jsCodeLocation launchOptions:launchOptions bridgeManagerDelegate:self];\n   ```\n8.

Open the `MainApplication.java` of your application.\n2. Add to the imports:\n   ```java\n   import org.unimodules.adapters.react.ModuleRegistryAdapter;\n   import org.unimodules.adapters.react.ReactAdapterPackage;\n   import org.unimodules.adapters.react.ReactModuleRegistryProvider;\n   import org.unimodules.core.interfaces.Package;\n   ```\n3. Create an instance variable on the `Application`:\n   ```java\n   private final ReactModuleRegistryProvider mModuleRegistryProvider = new ReactModuleRegistryProvider(Arrays.<Package>asList(\n       new ReactAdapterPackage()\n       // more packages, like\n       // new CameraPackage(), if you use expo-camera\n       // etc.\n   ), /* singletonModules */ null);\n   ```\n4. Add `new ModuleRegistryAdapter(mModuleRegistryProvider)` to the list returned by `protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages()`.\n5. You're good to go!\n\n## Usage\n\n### Calling methods on native modules\n\nNative modules are available behind the proxy (`NativeModulesProxy` of `@unimodules/core`).\n\nTo call an exported method, use `NativeModulesProxy[clientCodeName].exportedMethod(...arguments)`, like this:\n\n```js\n// For UM_REGISTER_MODULE(FileSystem,) or UM_REGISTER_UMPORTED_MODULE(FileSystem)\n// and UM_EXPORT_METHOD_AS(getInfo, getInfo:(NSString *)path)\n\n// or for method\n// @ExpoMethod\n// public void getInfo(String path, Promise promise)\n// defined in native module with name FileSystem\n\nimport { NativeModulesProxy } from '@unimodules/core';\n\nconst { FileSystem } = NativeModulesProxy;\n\nFileSystem.getInfo('file:///...');\n```\n\nNote that all the methods return `Promise`s.\n\n### Synthetic Platform Events\n\nWhen creating web universal modules, you may find that you need to send events back to the API layer.\nIn this case you will want to use the shared `SyntheticPlatformEmitter` instance from `@unimodules/core`. The shared emitter emit events to `react-native`'s `NativeEventEmitter` and `@unimodules/core`'s `EventEmitter` .\n\n`ExponentGyroscope.web.ts`\n\n```js\n// Example from expo-sensors native web gyroscope sensor\n\nimport { SyntheticPlatformEmitter } from '@unimodules/core';\n\nSyntheticPlatformEmitter.emit('gyroscopeDidUpdate', { x, y, z });\n```\n\nThis emitted event is then received with a `EventEmitter` in the developer-facing API.\n\n```js\nimport { EventEmitter } from '@unimodules/core';\n\nimport ExponentGyroscope from './ExponentGyroscope';\n\nconst nativeEmitter = new EventEmitter(ExponentGyroscope);\n\n// On Android and iOS, `nativeEmitter` receives events sent from Objective-C and Java. On web, it\n// receives events from the shared `SyntheticPlatformEmitter` instance.\nnativeEmitter.addListener('gyroscopeDidUpdate', ({ x, y, z }) => {});\n```",

It will either trim the results or add necessary amount of spaces. The `bias` control if trimming/padding should be done at the start of the string representing built children or at the end.\n\n```js\nfixed(5, 'start', 'ERR'); // => '  ERR'\nfixed(8, 'end', color('green', 'success')); // equals to color('green', 'success') + ' '\nfixed(10, 'end', 'Hello', pad(2), 'World') // => 'Hello  Wor'\n```\n\n#### `ifElse`\n\n```ts\nifElse(\n  condition: Condition,\n  ifTrueFragment: string | IFragment,\n  elseFragment: string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n\ntype ConditionValue = boolean | string | number | null | undefined;\ntype Condition = ConditionValue | (() => ConditionValue);\n```\n\nChange the output based on condition. Condition can ba a primitive value, which can be casted to boolean or a function. If conation or return value of condition is evaluated to `true`, the first argument - `ifTrueFragment` will be used, otherwise `elseFragment`.\n\n```js\nlet condition = getConditionValue()\nifElse(\n  () => condition,\n  color('red', 'ERROR'),\n  color('yellow', 'WARNING')\n)\n```\n\n#### `provide`\n\n```ts\nprovide<T>(\n  value: T,\n  builder: (value: T) => string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n```\n\nProvides given value to a builder function, which should return `string` or fragment. Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.\n\n```js\nprovide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {\n  switch (value.level) {\n    case 'error':\n      return container(\n        color('red', modifier('bold', value.level.toUpperCase())),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    case 'info':\n      return container(\n        color('blue', value.level.toUpperCase()),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    default:\n      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n<!-- badges (common) -->\n\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[prs-welcome-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[prs-welcome]: http://makeapullrequest.com\n[coc-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20of-conduct-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[coc]: https://github.com/zamotany/ansi-fragments/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-discord-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=7289DA&logo=discord\n[chat]: https://discord.gg/zwR2Cdh\n\n[version]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-fragments",

Most modern bundlers will use a package's ES modules by default (i.e.,\nif `package.json` has a `module` field). But if you need the plugin to rewrite\nimport paths to point to CommonJS modules, you must set the `commonjs` option\nto `true`.\n\n## Example\n\nNOTE: `react-native-web` internal paths are _not stable_ and you must not rely\non them. Always use the Babel plugin to optimize your build. What follows is an\nexample of the rewrite performed by the plugin.\n\n**Before**\n\n```js\nimport { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```js\nimport StyleSheet from 'react-native-web/dist/exports/StyleSheet';\nimport View from 'react-native-web/dist/exports/View';\n```\n\n[package-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/babel-plugin-react-native-web.svg?style=flat\n[package-url]: https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/babel-plugin-react-native-web",

If your project isn't using native font loading or web support then this preset will only add support for decorators with `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` - this is mostly used for supporting legacy community libraries.\n\nIf you start your **web** project with `@expo/webpack-config` or `expo start:web` and your project doesn't contain a `babel.config.js` or a `.babelrc` then it will default to using `babel-preset-expo` for loading.\n\nIf you have problems with the code in this repository, please file issues & bug reports\nat https://github.com/expo/expo. Thanks!\n\n## Expo Bundler Spec Compliance\n\nA bundler must follow these requirements if they are to be considered spec compliant for use with a **universal React** (Expo) project.\n\n### Babel Loader\n\nThe babel loading mechanism must include the following properties on its `caller`.\n\n#### platform\n\nA `platform` property denoting the target platform. If the `platform` is not defined, it will default to using `web` when the `bundler` is `webpack` -- this is temporary and will throw an error in the future.\n\n| Value     | Description             |\n| --------- | ----------------------- |\n| `ios`     | Runs on iOS devices     |\n| `android` | Runs on Android devices |\n| `web`     | Runs in web browsers    |\n\n#### bundler\n\nA `bundler` property denoting the name of the bundler that is being used to create the JavaScript bundle.\nIf the `bundler` is not defined, it will default to checking if a `babel-loader` is used, if so then `webpack` will be used, otherwise it will default to `metro`.\n\n| Value     | Description                      |\n| --------- | -------------------------------- |\n| `metro`   | Bundling with [Metro][metro]     |\n| `webpack` | Bundling with [Webpack][webpack] |\n\n[metro]: https://facebook.github.io/metro/\n[webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/\n\n## Options\n\n### [`lazyImports`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy)\n\nChanges Babel's compiled `import` statements to be lazily evaluated when their imported bindings are used for the first time.\n\n_Note:_ this option has an effect only when the `disableImportExportTransform` option is set to `false`. On Android and iOS, `disableImportExportTransform` defaults to `false`, and on web it defaults to `true` to allow for tree shaking.\n\nThis can improve the initial load time of your app because evaluating dependencies up front is sometimes entirely un-necessary, particularly when the dependencies have no side effects.\n\nThe value of `lazyImports` has a few possible effects:\n\n- `null` - [metro-react-native-babel-preset](https://github.com/facebook/metro/tree/master/packages/metro-react-native-babel-preset) will handle it. (Learn more about it here: https://github.com/facebook/metro/commit/23e3503dde5f914f3e642ef214f508d0a699851d)\n\n- `false` - No lazy initialization of any imported module.\n\n- `true` - Lazy-init all imported modules except local imports (e.g., `./foo`), certain Expo packages that have side effects, and the two cases mentioned [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy).\n\n- `Array<string>` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.\n\n- `(string) => boolean` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.\n\n  If you choose to do this, you can also access the list of Expo packages that have side effects by using `const lazyImportsBlacklist = require('babel-preset-expo/lazy-imports-blacklist');` which returns a `Set`.\n\n**default:** `null`\n\n```js\n[\n    'babel-preset-expo',\n    {\n        lazyImports: true\n    }\n],\n```\n\n### `web.disableImportExportTransform`\n\nEnabling this option will allow your project to run with older JavaScript syntax (i.e. `module.exports`). This option will break tree shaking and increase your bundle size, but will eliminate the following error when `module.exports` is used:\n\n> `TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'exports' of object '#<Object>'`\n\n**default:** `false`\n\n```js\n[\n    'babel-preset-expo',\n    {\n        web: { disableImportExportTransform: true }\n    }\n],\n```",

The Badging API works on Windows, and macOS, in Chrome 81 or later. It has also been confirmed to work on Edge 84 or later. Support for Chrome OS is in development and will be available in a future release of Chrome. On Android, the Badging API is not supported. Instead, Android automatically shows a badge on app icon for the installed web app when there is an unread notification, just as for Android apps. Since this API is not available everywhere, `badgin` safely falls back to alternatives.\n\n## via badge\n\nCurrently, the native badge is only displayed if you install the web application to your home screen (view [prerequisites](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners)). The screenshot shows the application in the dock of macOS.\n\n![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/standalone_osx.png)\n\n## via favicon\n\nIf the native badge is not available, the favicon will be used and a small badge will be added.\n\n![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/favicon.png)\n\n## via title\n\nIf the favicon is not available, the badge will be added as a prefix to the title.\n\n![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/title.png)\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can find a demo at https://jaulz.github.io/badgin/ where you can see the different options. If you want to see the native badge, you need to install the app to your home screen (check out the plus icon in the address bar).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe module can be installed by running:\n\n```\nyarn add --save badgin\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust use the library as following:\n\n```js\nimport badgin from 'badgin'\n\nbadgin.set(1) // set value\nbadgin.set() // set indicator only\nbadgin.clear()\n```\n\n### Options\n\nThe following options can be used:\n\n```js\n{\n  method: 'Badging' | 'Favicon' | 'Title'\n  favicon: {\n    backgroundColor: string = '#424242'\n    color: string = '#ffffff'\n    indicator: string = '!'\n    radius: number = 3\n    size: number = 7\n    horizontalMargin: number = 0\n    verticalMargin: number = 0\n    horizontalPadding: number = 1\n    verticalPadding: number = 1\n  }\n  title: {\n    indicator: string = '!'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd you can use it like this:\n\n```js\nbadgin.set(1, {\n  favicon: {\n    width: 9,\n    background: '#549A2F',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## License / Credits\n\nMIT\n\nThis is a refactored fork of the original Tinycon library, Tinycon is released under the MIT license.

Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected.

Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

This is especially useful if you are building [Twelve-Factor-Apps](http://www.12factor.net/) where all configuration is stored in the environment.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install getenv\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nSet environment variables:\n\n```bash\nexport HTTP_HOST=\"localhost\"\nexport HTTP_PORT=8080\nexport HTTP_START=true\nexport AB_TEST_RATIO=0.5\nexport KEYWORDS=\"sports,business\"\nexport PRIMES=\"2,3,5,7\"\n```\n\nGet and use them:\n\n```javascript\nvar getenv = require('getenv');\n\nvar host = getenv('HTTP_HOST'); // same as getenv.string('HTTP_HOST');\nvar port = getenv.int('HTTP_PORT');\nvar start = getenv.bool('HTTP_START');\n\nif (start === true) {\n  // var server = http.createServer();\n  // server.listen(port, host);\n}\n\nvar abTestRatio = getenv.float('AB_TEST_RATIO');\n\nif (Math.random() < abTestRatio) {\n  // test A\n} else {\n  // test B\n}\n\nvar keywords = getenv.array('KEYWORDS');\nkeywords.forEach(function(keyword) {\n  // console.log(keyword);\n});\n\nvar primes = getenv.array('PRIMES', 'int');\nprimes.forEach(function(prime) {\n  // console.log(prime, typeof prime);\n});\n```\n\n## Methods\n\nAll methods accept a fallback value that will be returned if the requested environment variable is not set. If the fallback value is omitted and if the requested environment variable does not exist, an exception is thrown.\n\n### env(name, [fallback])\n\nAlias for `env.string(name, [fallback])`.\n\n### env.string(name, [fallback])\n\nReturn as string.\n\n### env.int(name, [fallback])\n\nReturn as integer number.\n\n### env.float(name, [fallback])\n\nReturn as float number.\n\n### env.bool(name, [fallback])\n\nReturn as boolean. Only allows true/false as valid values.\n\n### env.boolish(name, [fallback])\n\nReturn as boolean. Allows true/false/1/0 as valid values.\n\n### env.array(name, [type], [fallback])\n\nSplit value of the environment variable at each comma and return the resulting array where each value has been typecast according to the `type` parameter. An array can be provided as `fallback`.\n\n### env.multi({spec})\n\nReturn a list of environment variables based on a `spec`:\n\n```javascript\nvar config = getenv.multi({\n  foo: \"FOO\", // throws if FOO doesn't exist\n  bar: [\"BAR\", \"defaultval\"], // set a default value\n  baz: [\"BAZ\", \"defaultval\", \"string\"], // parse into type\n  quux: [\"QUUX\", undefined, \"int\"] // parse & throw\n});\n\n```\n\n### env.url(name, [fallback])\n\nReturn a parsed URL as per Node's `require(\"url\").parse`. N.B `url` doesn't validate URLs, so be sure it includes a protocol or you'll get deeply weird results.\n\n```javascript\nvar serviceUrl = getenv.url('SERVICE_URL');\n\nserviceUrl.port; // parsed port number\n```\n\n### env.disableFallbacks()\n\nDisallows fallbacks in environments where you don't want to rely on brittle development defaults (e.g production, integration testing). For example, to disable fallbacks if we indicate production via `NODE_ENV`:\n\n```javascript\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\n  getenv.disableFallbacks();\n}\n```\n\n### env.disableErrors()\n\n`getenv` won't throw any error. If a fallback value is provided, that will be returned, else `undefined` is returned.\n\n```javascript\ngetenv.disableErrors();\nconsole.log(getenv(\"RANDOM\"));\n// undefined\n```\n\n### env.enableErrors()\n\nRevert the effect of `disableErrors()`.\n\n```javascript\ngetenv.disableErrors();\nconsole.log(getenv(\"RANDOM\"));\n// undefined\n\ngetenv.enableErrors();\nconsole.log(getenv(\"RANDOM\"));\n// Error: GetEnv.Nonexistent: RANDOM does not exist and no fallback value provided.\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v0.6.0\n- Added getenv.boolish() support.\n\n### v0.5.0\n- Add getenv.url() support.\n\n### v0.4.0\n- Add getenv.disableFallbacks() support.\n\n### v0.3.0\n- Add getenv.multi() support.\n\n### v0.2.0\n- Rename git repository\n\n### v0.1.0\n- Initial release\n\n## Authors\n\n- Moritz von Hase (initial author)\n- Christoph Tavan <dev@tavan.de>\n- Jonas Dohse <jonas@dohse.ch>\n- Jan Lehnardt (@janl): `getenv.multi()` support.\n- Tim Ruffles <timruffles@gmail.com>: `disableFallbacks()`, `url()`\n- Ashwani Agarwal <ashwani.a@outlook.com>: `disableErrors()`, `enableErrors()`\n\n## License\n\nThis module is licensed under the MIT license.",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "licenseText": "# metro-react-native-babel-preset\n\nBabel presets for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) applications. React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.\n\nIf you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `babel.config.js` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.\n\n## Usage\n\nAs mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `babel.config.js` file.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall `metro-react-native-babel-preset` in your app:\n\nwith `npm`:\n\n```sh\nnpm i metro-react-native-babel-preset --save-dev\n```\n\nor with `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add -d metro-react-native-babel-preset\n```\n\n### Configuring Babel\n\nThen, create a file called `babel.config.js` in your project's root directory. The existence of this `babel.config.js` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"module:metro-react-native-babel-preset\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's `babel.config.js` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.\n\n## Help and Support\n\nIf you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue.",

    "licenseText": "# `react-devtools-core`\n\nA standalone React DevTools implementation.\n\nThis is a low-level package. If you're looking for the Electron app you can run, **use `react-devtools` package instead.**\n\n## API\n\n### `react-devtools-core`\n\nThis is similar requiring the `react-devtools` package, but provides several configurable options. Unlike `react-devtools`, requiring `react-devtools-core` doesn't connect immediately but instead exports a function:\n\n```js\nconst { connectToDevTools } = require(\"react-devtools-core\");\nconnectToDevTools(config);\n```\n\nRun `connectToDevTools()` in the same context as React to set up a connection to DevTools.  \nBe sure to run this function *before* importing e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`.\n\nThe `config` object may contain:\n* `host: string` (defaults to \"localhost\") - Websocket will connect to this host.\n* `port: number` (defaults to `8097`) - Websocket will connect to this port.\n* `useHttps: boolean` (defaults to `false`) - Websocket should use a secure protocol (wss).\n* `websocket: Websocket` - Custom websocket to use. Overrides `host` and `port` settings if provided.\n* `resolveRNStyle: (style: number) => ?Object` - Used by the React Native style plug-in.\n* `retryConnectionDelay: number` (defaults to `2000`) - Milliseconds delay to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection.\n* `isAppActive: () => boolean` - If provided, DevTools will poll this method and wait until it returns true before connecting to React.\n\n## `react-devtools-core/standalone`\n\nRenders the DevTools interface into a DOM node.\n\n```js\nrequire(\"react-devtools-core/standalone\")\n  .setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\"container\"))\n  .setStatusListener(status => {\n    // This callback is optional...\n  })\n  .startServer(port);\n```\n\nRenders DevTools interface into a DOM node over SSL using a custom host name (Default is localhost).\n\n```js\nconst host = 'dev.server.com';\nconst options = {\n  key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),\n  cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')\n};\n\n\nrequire(\"react-devtools-core/standalone\")\n  .setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\"container\"))\n  .setStatusListener(status => {\n    // This callback is optional...\n  })\n  .startServer(port, host, options);\n```\n\nReference the `react-devtools` package for a complete integration example.\n\n## Development\n\nWatch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:backend\n```\n\nWatch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:standalone\n```",

The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tinitialSize: (100 * 1024),\t\t// start as 100 kilobytes.\r\n\tincrementAmount: (10 * 1024)\t// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE \t\t// (8 * 1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT\t// (8 * 1024)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting is standard Stream stuff:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);\r\n// - or -\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nstreamBuffers.size();\t\t\t// 4.\r\nstreamBuffers.maxSize();\t\t// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t\t\t\t// Gets all held data as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\");\t\t// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);\t\t\t\t\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\", 5);\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCare should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).\r\n \r\nDestroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();\r\n\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t// Returns ASDF in Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"Yeah?\");\t\t// No effect.\r\n```\t\r\n\r\n### Readable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nReadable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. \r\n\r\nThe frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tfrequency: 10,\t\t// in milliseconds.\r\n\tchunkSize: 2048\t\t// in bytes.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault frequency and chunk size:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE \t\t// (1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY\t\t\t// (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPutting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\t// Yup.\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. \r\n\r\nsetEncoding() for streams is respected too:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding(\"utf8\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof String);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. \r\n\r\nDestroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String!\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.size();\t\t\t// will be 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nNot supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThanks to the following people for taking some time to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\n * Igor Dralyuk <idralyuk@ebay.com>\r\n * Simon Koudijs <simon.koudijs@intellifi.nl>\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nnode-stream-buffer is free and unencumbered public domain software.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "licenseText": "# ws: a node.js websocket library\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/ws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/ws)\n\n`ws` is a simple to use WebSocket implementation, up-to-date against RFC-6455,\nand [probably the fastest WebSocket library for node.js][archive].\n\nPasses the quite extensive Autobahn test suite. See http://websockets.github.com/ws\nfor the full reports.\n\n## Protocol support\n\n* **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera.\n  Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the\n  `disableHixie` option to true.)\n* **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`)\n* **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`)\n\n### Installing\n\n```\nnpm install --save ws\n```\n\n### Opt-in for performance\n\nThere are 2 optional modules that can be installed along side with the `ws`\nmodule. These modules are binary addons which improve certain operations, but as\nthey are binary addons they require compilation which can fail if no c++\ncompiler is installed on the host system.\n\n- `npm install --save bufferutil`: Improves internal buffer operations which\n  allows for faster processing of masked WebSocket frames and general buffer\n  operations.\n- `npm install --save utf-8-validate`: The specification requires validation of\n  invalid UTF-8 chars, some of these validations could not be done in JavaScript\n  hence the need for a binary addon. In most cases you will already be\n  validating the input that you receive for security purposes leading to double\n  validation. But if you want to be 100% spec-conforming and have fast\n  validation of UTF-8 then this module is a must.\n\n### Sending and receiving text data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function(data, flags) {\n  // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received.\n  // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked.\n});\n```\n\n### Sending binary data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  var array = new Float32Array(5);\n\n  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {\n    array[i] = i / 2;\n  }\n\n  ws.send(array, { binary: true, mask: true });\n});\n```\n\nSetting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be\nmasked according to the WebSocket protocol. The same option applies for text\ndata.\n\n### Server example\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log('received: %s', message);\n  });\n\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n```\n\n### ExpressJS example\n\n```js\nvar server = require('http').createServer()\n  , url = require('url')\n  , WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: server })\n  , express = require('express')\n  , app = express()\n  , port = 4080;\n\napp.use(function (req, res) {\n  res.send({ msg: \"hello\" });\n});\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  var location = url.parse(ws.upgradeReq.url, true);\n  // you might use location.query.access_token to authenticate or share sessions\n  // or ws.upgradeReq.headers.cookie (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/16395220/151312)\n\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log('received: %s', message);\n  });\n\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n\nserver.on('request', app);\nserver.listen(port, function () { console.log('Listening on ' + server.address().port) });\n```\n\n### Server sending broadcast data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.broadcast = function broadcast(data) {\n  wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {\n    client.send(data);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n### Error handling best practices\n\n```js\n// If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted\nws.send('something');\n\n// Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional\n// callback. The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has\n// actually been sent.\nws.send('something', function ack(error) {\n  // if error is not defined, the send has been completed,\n  // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed.\n});\n\n// Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note** that\n// since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not* be\n// captured when this technique is used.\ntry { ws.send('something'); }\ncatch (e) { /* handle error */ }\n```\n\n### echo.websocket.org demo\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org/', {\n  protocolVersion: 8,\n  origin: 'http://websocket.org'\n});\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  console.log('connected');\n  ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n});\n\nws.on('close', function close() {\n  console.log('disconnected');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function message(data, flags) {\n  console.log('Roundtrip time: ' + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + 'ms', flags);\n\n  setTimeout(function timeout() {\n    ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n  }, 500);\n});\n```\n\n### Other examples\n\nFor a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the\nexamples folder.\n\nNote that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express\n2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.\n\nOtherwise, see the test cases.\n\n### Running the tests\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\n## API Docs\n\nSee [`/doc/ws.md`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md) for Node.js-like docs for the ws classes.\n\n## Changelog\n\nWe're using the GitHub [`releases`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases) for changelog entries.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Einar Otto Stangvik &lt;einaros@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[archive]: http://web.archive.org/web/20130314230536/http://hobbycoding.posterous.com/the-fastest-websocket-module-for-nodejs",
